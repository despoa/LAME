If you got the LAME source from http://www.sulaco.org/mp3, the
libraries and binaries mentioned below are not included.  You will
need to get the GLIB and GTK developer libraries, available from:
http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/ 
(or see http://www.gtk.org, and click on the GTK under win32 link).

www.gtk.org, find the WINGTK link
download glib-dev-VERSION.zip
         gtk+-dev-VERSION.zip
         extralibs-dev-VERSION.zip
where VERSION = something like 20000201
unzip the files.  this will make a "src" directory.
(for example, c:\gtk\src)
in MSVC, under Tools->options->directories, add 
to the include files and library files settings:
  c:\gtk\src\glib
  c:\gtk\src\gtk+\glib
  c:\gtk\src\gtk+

to run the lame.exe, you have to install the following DLL's,
(or put them in the same directory as lame.exe)
glib-1.3.dll
gdk-1.3.dll
gtk-1.3.dll
gmodule-1.3.dll

either into the current working direcory you are running LAME, or 
copy them in the windows system directory. 


This is basically it, you can run LAME with the Graphic Psyco Analysis as follows:

Lame -g my.wav

(just enter Lame at the dos prompt to get all the options) Of course you can ommit the 
-g optiont to use lame without GPA.



How to compile Lame with GPA for Windows 32 platforms

In order to compile Lame with the Graphic Psyco Analysis (GPA) with MSVC, you have to have the 
proper GTK and GLIB include files and lib files. I've put these files together in a 
zip file (named GtkWin32Lib.zip). Unzip these files into the Lame source directory, make
sure you unpack it with the directory options. The files are created in the WinGTK subdirecory
Furthermore, you should have at least Lame version 3.05 beta 2.
Open the project files in MSVC 5, and just hit the build button. There will be a few warnings,
but you can ignore them.
