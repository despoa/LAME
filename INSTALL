LAME 3.xx    9/99 Mark Taylor (http://www.sulaco.org/mp3)

Building the MPEG audio encoding software:
=======================================================================
If you are reading this, you have already applied the patch to the
dist10 ISO demonstration source (or downloaded a full source
distrubtion).  If you do not have GTK 1.1.16 or higher, or do not want
the graphical frame analyzer (it uses a lot of memory), edit the
Makefile and dont define GTK and GTKLIBS.  If you have trouble with
libncurses/libtermcap, you can also disable that in the Makefile.

Now just type:

% make

If it doesn't work, figure out why and send me the fix!  
If you are using a newer version of EGCS, check the Makefile.
There are some flags which may improve performance.

LAME has built in support for 16bit raw pcm, aiff and simple wav
formats.  Some complex .wav headers will confuse LAME. If you have
trouble with this, or want to encode from other sound formats, you can
now compile LAME to use Erik de Castro Lopo's libsndfile.  To use
libsndfile in LAME:

  1. install libsndfile (see http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/).  
  2. set SNDLIB and LIBSNDFILE as shown in the LAME Makefile.  
  3. make clean ; make

Thanks to Albert Faber for adding the libsndfile support!

LAME can also be compiled into a BladeEnc compatiable MS Windows .dll 
file.  See the Dll/ directory for details.

To encode:

see the file "USAGE" for some usage guidlines.

Portability
=======================================================================
LAME 3.x has been run on every modern OS.  see the Makefile.
