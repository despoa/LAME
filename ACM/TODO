- create a smart mode (change output freq. , disable stupid settings 48kHz/48kbps) -> test in VirtualDub

- known bug : when recording, converting, and recording a lame_close() call fail
- see desync problems in VirtualDub (1152 bytes -> 1 byte ?)
- check and try to fill the MPEGLAYER3WAVEFORMAT the same way as the FhG codec (encoding)
- or try to remove the structure (size = 0)
- add the preset modes (and alt-preset too) in the config
- allow decompression the same way as in the command-line
- allow VBR/ABR mode
- allow channel resampling (mono to stereo / stereo to mono)
- allow internal resampling (difference in the format suggestion)
- use global pointers for string
- use the bitrate/freq tables from LAME

LAME general
- avoid to allow the buffer in lame_encode_buffer and lame_encode_buffer_interleaved (if possible)
