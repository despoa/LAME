************************************************************************
LAME is supposed to become more modular.  It can be used as a standalone
library now, although the interface is not great.  See the
mp3rtp.c for an example of how the interface is used.  See the makefile
entry for mp3rtp for examples of compiling mp3rtp and linking with
libmp3lame.a  


************************************************************************
LAME API

General outline of the code (see main.c)

gf=lame_init(no_write,no_read)   
                         called before encoding a file
                         Set no_write=1 if you want to do your file output
                         Set no_read=1  if you want to do your own file input

lame_parse_args(int, char **) 
                         called to set encoding options (gf->*), and input 
                         and output filenames.  You can ignore this routine
                         and set all desired encoding options yourself

lame_init_params()       Initialize based on set encoding options


while not eof:
   out=lame_readframe(inBuffer)                 input one frame of data
   out=lame_encodeframe(inBuffer,outBuffer)     encode one frame of data

lame_cleanup(outBuffer)                         close files, flush buffers



lame_encodeframe():
   l3psycho_anal()        compute masking thresholds
   mdct_sub()             compute MDCT coefficients
   iteration_loop()       choose scalefactors (via iteration)
                          which determine noise shapping, and 
                          choose best huffman tables for lossless compression

   III_formatBitstream    format the bitstream and store in bit_buffer
   copy_buffer()          make a copy of bit_buffer, to return to calling program
   write_buffer()         optionally output bit_buffer to a file
   empty_buffer()	  mark bit_buffer as empty





************************************************************************
We are in the process of switching the whole code to FLOAT, which
defined in machine.h.  Avoid using float or double, and instead use:

FLOAT    4 byte floating point.  
FLOAT8   8 byte floating point (only when necessary)


************************************************************************
Initialization:   LAME can be used as a library, and there are two
kinds of static data:  data that has to be initialized only once
when the library is called, and data that has to be initialized
every time you start encoding a new sample.

These routines should be coded something like:

#include "globalflags"
void subroutine(void)
{
  static int firstcall=1;
  if (firstcall) {
    firstcall=0;
    /* code that needs to be done only once when routine is loaded */
  }
  if (frameNum==0) {
    /* code that needs to be done before encoding each file/stream */
  }
}



************************************************************************
Global flags

For better or worse, there are many global flags in lame.  
The rules for adding a global flag are:

1. declair in struct gf in globalflags.h
2. default values must be set in lame_init()
