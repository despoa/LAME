library:  User defined call backs for error messages and 
          display messages.  Right now this is a #define MACRO
          which can be disabled at compile time.  Default
          build will create a library which displays error messages
          to stderr.

frontend: a bunch of static variables (input_format, swapbytes,
          silent, brhist, update_inteval) are set in parse_args and used in
          get_audio.  should be cleaned up.


Makefile.{B32,DJGPP} all broken?

These makefiles should only bother to build the static lib,
(or compile everything without even using the library)
and then make lame, mp3x and/or the dll.  Any system interested in
the shared library should be able to use ./configure. 


1.
ACM wrapper for LAME.

Contact "Florian Bruckner" <h9651030@miraculix.wu-wien.ac.at> for info - 
he is working on the VorbisACM.


1.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)


2. 
LAME has problems with pure DC input.  i.e. a square wave with
a frequency well below 20 Hz.  Not very important, but it should
be fixed.


3. 
modify mpglib to output
floating point and have finaly quantization step a
easy-to-change module so it can output other than 16bit.



998.
Merge GOGO's fast assembler routines.

It would be nice to save some information whilst encoding
a: wave -> mp3
	a RIFF/wave can contain LIST chunks with information
	about author, title, etc. 
	==> could go into TAG fields of resulting mp3
b: mp3 -> mp3
	==> we could copy the TAG directly
c: mp3 <-> ogg
	==> copy TAG info into oggs info field and vice versa
d: mp3 -> wave
	==> copy TAG into LIST chunk
