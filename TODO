1. Modularization:

BladeEnc.dll was written before lame was 'modularized'
this should be cleaned up to look like main.c:  It should be possible
to write the BladeEnc/lame dll so that it just uses
#include "lame.h" and then calls to various lame_*() routines


2.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)
