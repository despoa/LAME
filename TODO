There's some problem in very the first frame MDCT calculation.


1.
LAME has problems with test signals.
1. pure DC input.(i.e. a square wave with a frequency well below 20 Hz)
2. sin sweep signal (i.e. 20Hz->22kHz in 60sec)
3. steep/saw wave (i.e. 100Hz)
Seems not very important, but they are related to "REAL" problem of
some kind of music. 1 and 2 are caused by ATH handling problem.
3 is by short block threshold problem.



3. Some switches to support the "BUGGY" decoders.
--strictly-enforce-ISO is not perfect to these players.
It seems it needs forcing coupling block type, lower IXMAX_VAL, no
scfsi, no scalefact_scale, and so on. 



4.
There're some sound quality regression compared with LAME3.x
- short block problem (i.e. spahm.wav)

LAME4's block switching is better than LAME3 with nspsy,
but the threshold calculation of short blocks is not.
It does not support temporal masking, and so on.

At the high frequency region, LAME4 increases the threshold too much.
And more the worse, there's sfb21 :(



5.
Better intensity stereo.
And LAME4 should support it when MPEG2 Layer3 (currently not).

Note: mpg123 (and all derivatives, like xmms and lame/mpglib)
have bugs in the intensity stereo decoding.  Bugs have been there
for years since there are very few intensity stereo mp3's out there.




8.
Tuning reservoir handling (especially for low bitrates); CBR/ABR arround
90kbps (-b 90) is much worse than VBR quality 9 (-V 9). This is probabry
because of poor resorvoir handling.

Right now the code is tuned with the LAME3's pe calculation and
psymodel. Now they are all changed and we should re-tune these code.

2-pass VBR/ABR will perfectly solve the problem, but before it,
we should improve the 1-pass encoding.


9.
We should rewrite all the documentation, such as PRESET, INSTALL, README*,...


10.
Clipping detection and replaygain tag:
LAME 3.x supports this, but LAME4 does not.


15. 
LAME has a 31 point FIR filter used for resampling, which
can also be used as a lowpass.  When resampling is done, 
use that filter to also lowpass instead of the polyphase filter.


16.
Even when resampling is not needed, should we use an FIR filter
for the lowpass?  If it is not too much slower, yes.  If it
is slower, then it should be an option since it will produce
higher quality.  


17.
better highpass/lowpass filter:
We need to first replace the polyphase filter with an FIR filter.
And setting highpass filtering to enhance the playback frequency range.


20.
Replacing the resampling code of ssrc (Shibatch sampling rate conv.)
will bring better result.



30.
mp3x cannot display (seg-faults) short file like testcase.new.mp3.
(LAME3.x has this bug, too)


50.
Better tonality estimation.
Nspsytune seems to miss tonals when several of them are too narrow.
maybe nspsy2 based model will solve it.



70.
Use mixed blocks.




998.
Merge GOGO's fast assembler routines.




1500.
Integrate plusV extensions




decoding core:
1.
mp3 decoding is not reentrant nor thread safe.

2.
mp3 decoder crashes when some invlid mp3 file.

3
mgplib has bugs with i-stereo.  flag denoting invalid
i-stereo value (= frame is m/s stereo) is not correct.

4. 
modify mpglib to output floating point and have finaly quantization
step a easy-to-change module so it can output other than 16bit.
(replace mpglib with MAD?  MAD has agreed to write a call back
which will return all data needed by the frame analyzer)






NOGAP encoding:

-nogap:  more testing, fix options, test id3 tags?
Can we change id3 tags without reseting the encoder??
At the end of encoding 1.wav, call lame_get_mf_samples_to_encode()
to find the number of non encoded buffered PCM samples.  Then
encode samples from 2.wav until these PCM samples have been
encoded, *THEN* call lame_encode_flush_nogap() and close
out file 1.mp3.


NOGAP decoding:  
lame --decode --nogap file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.mp3
should also work.  What needs to be done:
get_audio.c:  We need a way to open a second mp3 file, without
              calling lame_decode_init() and reinitializing mpglib.
              And the mpglib needs to know to look for new Xing
              tags at the beginning of file2.mp3 and file3.mp3.


frontend code:

1.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)

2.
Code is a complete mess. But it has so many debugged features it will
be a lot of work to re-write.

8.
We should consider moving the experts options from the *long
help* text into an *experts only* help text. The average Joe gets
knocked down by the huge number of possibilities to setup lame.

999.
It would be nice to save some information whilst encoding when
wave <-> mp3
	a RIFF/wave can contain LIST chunks with information
	about author, title, etc. 
	id3tag in mp3 can contain these information, too.

	auto converting each of them may be good.



Build environment
1. MSVC project files.  It would be nice to create a working
   MSVC6 workspace, which included all the projects as possible
   targets:
          lame.exe
          mp3x.exe   (require GTK libs)
          lame_enc.dll   
          ACM codec
          directshow codec

2. more 64 bit environment support.

3. check the "HACKY and FAST" code on many environments. They are
really fast, but are not confirmed to run on all environments.

4. NASM version check. LAME4 needs nasm 0.98.38 (or maybe upper).
