1. Modularization:

BladeEnc.dll was written before lame was 'modularized'
this should be cleaned up to look like main.c:  It should be possible
to write the BladeEnc/lame dll so that it just uses
#include "lame.h" and then calls to various lame_*() routines


2.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)

It would be nice to save some information whilst encoding
a: wave -> mp3
	a RIFF/wave can contain LIST chunks with information
	about author, title, etc. 
	==> could go into TAG fields of resulting mp3
b: mp3 -> mp3
	==> we could copy the TAG directly
c: mp3 <-> ogg
	==> copy TAG info into oggs info field and vice versa
d: mp3 -> wave
	==> copy TAG into LIST chunk
